obtain the relation between the customerâ€™s characteristics and the churn. and then to develope a model that predicts if the customer is going to churn the company's
services or not.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available in the Kaggle and contains nineteen columns that indicate the characteristicsof the clients of a fictional 
telecommunications corporation. The Churn column indicates whether the customer departed within the last month or not.
